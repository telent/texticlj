h1. Texticlj

_note that inline elements are not yet implemented_

A Clojure library designed to process an "approximate subset" of the Textile text markup format.  It probably doesn't do exactly the same as textile in any strange or borderline cases, but it generally does what I want instead.

Based on https://github.com/telent/texticl

The input is a lump of text.  Processing is as follows:

# separate it into block-level elements

    p h[123456] bq

Each element is introduced by its name followed by "." and finished by
a blank line.  If the element name is missing, assume p

# find ordered and unordered lists

    ^#+ ' or '^*+ ' 
    
mark the start of a list item; nesting depth is given by the number of
hashes or stars. The item runs until (a) the next item, or (b) the end
of the block.

# within each block, look for character sequences that delimit inline
elements

" *" bold  "* "
" _" underline  "_ "

... etc

# links, footnotes, tables, stuff lik that all TBD
